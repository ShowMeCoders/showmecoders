ShowMeCoders is a platform which allows Missouri participants in the Grow With Google Challenge to share information about themselves - background, education, military services, interests & hobbies, and the story of their journey as a Web Developer. In addition, each participant can also choose to share links to the resources they've found to be inspiring, useful, or just plain interesting.

This app has been developed by a group of Missouri-based students in the [Front End Web Development](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud304-gwg) track of the Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship. It's primary purpose is to allow the development team to showcase the skills they've acquired in the Grow With Google Challenge.

You can find ShowMeCoders at [showmecoders.zyphyrmedia.org](http://showmecoders.zyphyrmedia.org).

## Features

TBD

## Development

### Git Branches

- `master`: Only updated from PR's from the `development` branch for release. This
branch always reflects the current production release.
- `development`: Reflects the candidate code for the next release. Developers
work in working branches, which are then pulled into this branch. All code
pulled into this branch must be tested and undergo peer review as part of the
PR process.
- `working branches`: Are individual branches created by each developer when
they are working on changes and bug fixes. There are 4 basic types of branches: 
bug, feature, refactor and style, after the type comes the name, it should 
specify on top of the branch type. For example feature/course-review.
