            <img src="images/aboutpic.jpg">
            
            <p class="aboutText">A native of Kansas City, I have been blessed to see and do some pretty amazing things over my nearly four decades of life.</p>

            <p class="aboutText">I grew up in the Kansas City area (specifically Belton) until high school, when my family moved to a small town near Whiteman Air Force Base.  After graduating from high school, I made a few mistakes here and there--and then made one of the best decisions of my life.</p>  
            
            <p class="aboutText">Following in the footsteps of my father, grandfather, and several uncles, I enlisted in the United States Navy.  From 1999 to 2005, I had the opportunity to learn advanced electronics and circuitry, electrical operation, radar operation and maintenance, and in-depth hydraulic and pneumatic mechanics, and also earning an associate's in electronics engineering.  All the while, I had the opportunity to travel across the world, being stationed at commands and on ships located in Chicago, San Diego, Norfolk, and even Sasebo, Japan.  I've sailed on 3 of the world's 4 oceans (that's right, I don't recognize the so-called Southern Ocean; also, Pluto is still a planet--convince me otherwise), and visited over 20 countries on 4 continents.  All in all, not bad at all.</p>

            <p class="aboutText">Once I finished up my time in the Navy, I went back to school, earning a B.A. in political science with a minor in business in 2009, and eventually a J.D. in 2012, all from the University of Missouri. While at Mizzou, I served as a senator in student government, a political columnist for a student newspaper, a class representative for the student government in law school, and was active with several groups, including the Mizzou Student Veterans Association, Board of Advocates, and others.</p> 
                
            <p class="aboutText">During this time and then after finishing school, I also completed an internship in the Washington, DC office of former U.S. Senator Christopher S. "Kit" Bond, and then served as a legislative assistant for Missouri State Representative Mark Parkinson, and then as chief of staff for Missouri State Senator Ryan Silvey.</p>

            <p class="aboutText">In 2017, my wife and I relocated to the Greater St. Louis area for family reasons.  In turn, this allowed me the opportunity to do something I had contemplated for a couple of years: change careers.  I had burned out long before that, and became cynical and jaded with the entire process.  In addition, several things had changed in my life, which changed my own personal values, my political ideology, and what I was willing to do to succeed in my career.</p>

            <p class="aboutText">I now work as an archives technician during the day, and do freelance web design and development work.  I'm also working through the Grow with Google program and Udacity, hoping to potentially turn this into a full-time career.  Programming and coding have always been enjoyable to me, but I now want more than just a hobby from it.</p>

            <p class="aboutText bottom">When I'm not doing all of that, you can find me at church, reading, listening to music, or watching sports--namely football, baseball, and (yes,) professional wrestling.  I live in Saint Charles County with my beautiful wife of four years, and our fur son Atticus, whom we rescued from a shelter.  My eventual life goal is to use whatever small skills I have to make the world a better place, and then retire and live on a mountain covered in snow most of the year.</p>
